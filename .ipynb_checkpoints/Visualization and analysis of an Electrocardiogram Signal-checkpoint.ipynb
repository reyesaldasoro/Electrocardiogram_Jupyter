If you follow the section \"Lecture notes, lab exercises, and signal data files\" you will find a large number of signals from different acquisition modalities (ECG, EEG, EMF, etc.). You can save the files from a browser to your hard drive and then open with the command load as above. Alternatively, you can also read the data sets directly. The following lines will show you how to do this."
