Visualization and analysis of an Electrocardiogram Signal

These exercises will take you step by step in the process of reading, displaying and analysing in a simple way a signal of an Electrocardiogram. The first exercise (Visualization and analysis of an Electrocardiogram Signal.ipynb) is parallel to a Matlab Live Script of the same name and function. The script was awarded third place in the MATLAB Online Live Editor Challenge:

The second exercise (ECG_Visualisation_Bokeh.ipynb) introduces the visualisation tools from Bokeh, since these are really good and powerful, besides the visualisation, a finer analysis can be performed.
